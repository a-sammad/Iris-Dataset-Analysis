Excited to share my latest Data Analysis Project!

I recently completed an exploratory data analysis project using Python on the famous Iris Dataset.

In this project, I performed:
 Data exploration using Pandas
 Data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
 Scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to analyze feature relationships

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization and analytical thinking.

I’m continuously improving my Data Analytics and Python skills and looking forward to building more real-world projects.
